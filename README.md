# Pig-Invaders
Html shooting game developed for my very demanding grandchildren.  They wanted something with shooting and explosions, working on all platforms, challenging, but not too difficult for the younger ones to play.  So with thanks to them and other members of the family for their advice and suggestions and special thanks to Jules for his contribution; here it is, loosely based on my memory of Atari’s space invaders, “can you get them before they get you”.

We have developed a game based purely on divs i.e. it does not use canvas, but the 3d transforms now available in html5.  To have a reasonable experience in Safari, we had to abandoned the use of css 100vh and 100vw and instead resize the game container to window.innerWidth and window.innerHeight.  I thought Apple was better than this, it’s a pity!

Anyway if you want to play the game:-
